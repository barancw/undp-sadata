  # The secret_key_base is used to verify the integrity of signed content, most commonly
  # cookies. It may be set to anything, with the proviso that if it is changed, any content
  # signed with the old value will be invalid. If a new secret is required, a new value can be
  # generated using the `rake secret` command.
